          <p>I’m a designer born in Poland and based in the Netherlands, where I’m doing my BA in Graphic Design at Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK). In my practise I combine graphic design with autonomous projects involving writing, research and sound. The most often interests I touch upon with my work are: decentralization, political listening, nature, in-between spaces. I work both on self-initiated projects as well as collaborate with other artists and collectives.</p>
          <p>I’m a member of the polish collective <a target="_blank" href="https://lnk.bio/i4xL">DESTITUTE</a> which aims at building inclusive space for arts & music from Poland and Central/ Eastern Europe as well as <a target="_blank"
